# WGU_Inventory_System_Project
This is an in-progress project for C482 Software I at WGU. This Inventory Management System allows a user to add, modify, and delete parts and products to a database using a GUI. While the code compiles and the GUI is interactive, the functionality of storing and transferring user inputs is still a work in progress.


## Technology
This project is written in Java, using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) to create the GUI.
